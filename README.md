# NavMorph: A Self-Evolving World Model for Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments

**Xuan Yao, Junyu Gao, and Changsheng Xu**

This repository is the official implementation of NavMorph: A Self-Evolving World Model for Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments.

> Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) requires agents to execute sequential navigation actions in complex environments guided by natural language instructions. Current approaches often struggle with generalizing to novel environments and adapting to ongoing changes during navigation.
Inspired by human cognition, we present NavMorph, a self-evolving world model framework that enhances environmental understanding and decision-making in VLN-CE tasks. NavMorph employs compact latent representations to model environmental dynamics, equipping agents with foresight for adaptive planning and policy refinement. By integrating a novel Contextual Evolution Memory, NavMorph leverages scene-contextual information to support effective navigation while maintaining online adaptability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves notable performance improvements on popular VLN-CE benchmarks.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

1. Follow the [Habitat Installation Guide](https://github.com/facebookresearch/habitat-lab#installation) and [VLN-CE](https://github.com/jacobkrantz/VLN-CE) to install [`habitat-lab`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/habitat-lab) and [`habitat-sim`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/habitat-sim). We use version `v0.2.1` in our experiments.
   
2. Install `torch_kdtree` and `tinycudann`: follow instructions [here](https://github.com/MrZihan/Sim2Real-VLN-3DFF). 

3. Install requirements:
```setup
conda create --name morph python=3.7.11
conda activate morph
```
* Required packages are listed in `environment.yaml`. You can install by running:

```
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```
4. Please download the pretrained models and checkpoints from [GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x01wods-LUA6EyAD8C3ahiEaO8lKD6jy/view?usp=sharing).


### Training for R2R-CE / RxR-CE

Use pseudo interative demonstrator to train the world model Navmorph:
```
bash run_r2r/main.bash train # (run_rxr/main.bash)
```

### Online Evaluation on R2R-CE / RxR-CE

Use pseudo interative demonstrator to equip the model with our NavMorph:
```
bash run_r2r/main.bash eval # (run_rxr/main.bash)
```

### Notes

When transitioning from the RxR dataset to the R2R dataset based on the baseline code, you will need to adjust the camera settings in three places to prevent any simulation issues.

1. **Camera HFOV and VFOV Adjustment**:  
   In [vlnce_bacelines/models/etp/nerf.py](https://github.com/Feliciaxyao/NavMorph/blob/ae3246b902cdedf8533211ff62b2062cb9ed0e39/vlnce_baselines/models/etp/nerf.py#L57-L60), update the camera's **HFOV** and **VFOV**:
   - Set `HFOV = 90` for R2R.
   - Set `HFOV = 79` for RxR.

2. **Dataset Setting**:  
   In [vlnce_bacelines/models/Policy_ViewSelection_ETP.py](https://github.com/Feliciaxyao/NavMorph/blob/ae3246b902cdedf8533211ff62b2062cb9ed0e39/vlnce_baselines/models/Policy_ViewSelection_ETP.py#L41), modify the `DATASET` variable:
   - Set `DATASET = 'R2R'` for R2R.
   - Set `DATASET = 'rxr'` for RxR.

3. **Camera Configuration**:  
   In [vlnce_baselines/ss_trainer_ETP.py](https://github.com/Feliciaxyao/NavMorph/blob/ae3246b902cdedf8533211ff62b2062cb9ed0e39/vlnce_baselines/ss_trainer_ETP.py#L181), ensure the camera configuration is updated:
   - Set `camera.config.HFOV = 90` for R2R.
   - Set `camera.config.HFOV = 79` for RxR.

These adjustments are essential for proper camera calibration and to avoid discrepancies during simulation.
